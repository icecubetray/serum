Special thanks to:

- My parents for making and maintaining me, and especially my dad because he's
  also my taxi driver.

- My girlfriend for being my girlfriend, and thus making me a cool nerd.

- Dennis Ritchie, for C (and partly Unix). Most amazing language ever.

- Developers, maintainers, and donators of Arch Linux (my all-time favorite
  distro, I'd slap a sticker saying Arch-Powered on this project if I could).

- Italians, for making pasta, pizza, and other stuff.

- My college, for making me realize that I could be off worse (by e.g. becoming
  a programming teacher). (Note that my school has been ripping me and other
  students off by making us pay money to learn... NOTHING.)
