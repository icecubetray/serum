# Serum \[[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/icecubetray/serum.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/icecubetray/serum)\]
**Experimental** standalone toolkit, licensed under the [MIT license](./COPYING.md). Supposed to be cross-platform.

For now nothing can really be found in this README, so I'd like to point you to the [Doxygen generated documentation](docs/index.html).
